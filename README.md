# GeeGaw
GeeGaw is a mock up instagram web application. Built for practice with the MEAN stack and collaborating using git branches and uploading photos/files to a database. 

## News Feed
Just like the instagram, GeeGaw is built around a "news feed" style get-all api call, pulling all the posts(photos) of all the users the logged in user is following. 

## Uploading Photos
The biggest challenge of the project is letting users upload photos and control those photos in terms of size.

### Additional Features
Once the essential structure is built we plan on adding search features.
